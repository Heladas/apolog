# Apolog

A Javascript testing adapter that fits with [Jasmine](https://github.com/jasmine/jasmine), [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) or any other BDD framework that uses "describe" and "it".
The main goal is to provide a simple interface that process any .feature file written in [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/gherkin-javascript) and link it with the specs.
